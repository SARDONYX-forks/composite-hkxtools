# Composite HKX Conversion Tool

A Windows GUI that wraps hkxcmd, serde-hkx, and hkxconv for converting in between SSE HKX, LE, HKX, XML, and KF for behavior/animation modding.

I forked HKX Conversion Tool after opening a bugfix PR to serde-hkx, because I was making sure my upcoming behavior mod was working and properly creating patch files. It evolved from just adding hkxcmd to the app to also including hkxconv, since some people were asking for kf handling in the other page.
