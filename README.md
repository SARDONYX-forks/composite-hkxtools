# HKX Conversion Tool

HKX Conversion Tool is a GUI wrapper for hkxc.exe for converting Havok files between different formats for Skyrim modding. 

I initially started building a wrapper for hkxcmd, but since that doesn't handle amd64 hkx files, I was also integrating hkxconv to convert those into xmls first and pushing those xmls through hkxcmd, and then I got upset that the solution was messy and started to look at their source code to try and build a modern version that handles win32, amd64 and xml format conversions between each other. Thankfully I didn't get too far into reinventing the wheel before I found out someone built this already, so I just repurposed the GUI tool for their tool since It Just Worksâ„¢.

Working with havok files is really a pain in the ass, since Blender's hkx plugin can't import Skyrim SE/amd64 hkx formats, they have to all be converted to win32 Oldrim format first. A lot of the existing guides will tell you to find and install Havok Content Tools and use hctStandAloneFilterManager.exe. That pissed me off every time I had to edit an existing SE animation because you have to do one animation at a time and the whole process takes a lot of clicks every time.
